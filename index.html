			<p><sup>1</sup> The words of the blessing of Enoch, wherewith he blessed the elect and righteous, who will be <sup>2</sup> living in the day of tribulation, when all the wicked and godless are to be removed. And he took up his parable and said - Enoch, a righteous man, whose eyes were opened by God, saw the vision of the Holy One in the heavens, which the angels showed me, and from them I heard everything, and from them I understood as I saw, but not for this generation, but for a remote one which is <sup>3</sup> for to come. Concerning the elect I said, and took up my parable concerning them:</p>

<p>The Holy Great One will come forth from His dwelling,<br>
<sup>4</sup> And the eternal God will tread upon the earth, (even) on Mount Sinai,<br>
[And appear from His camp]<br>
And appear in the strength of His might from the heaven of heavens.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> And all shall be smitten with fear<br>
And the Watchers shall quake,<br>
And great fear and trembling shall seize them unto the ends of the earth.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> And the high mountains shall be shaken,<br>
And the high hills shall be made low,<br>
And shall melt like wax before the flame.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> And the earth shall be wholly rent in sunder,<br>
And all that is upon the earth shall perish,<br>
And there shall be a judgement upon all (men).</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> But with the righteous He will make peace.<br><br>
And will protect the elect,<br>
And mercy shall be upon them.<br><br>
And they shall all belong to God,<br>
And they shall be prospered,<br>
And they shall all be blessed.<br><br>
And He will help them all,<br>
And light shall appear unto them,<br>
And He will make peace with them.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> And behold! He cometh with ten thousands of His holy ones<br>
To execute judgement upon all,<br>
And to destroy all the ungodly:<br><br>
And to convict all flesh<br>
Of all the works of their ungodliness which they have ungodly committed,<br>
And of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.</p>

I saw the winds of heaven which turn and bring the circumference of the sun and <sup>5</sup> all the stars to their setting. I saw the winds on the earth carrying the clouds: I saw the paths <sup>6</sup> of the angels. I saw at the end of the earth the firmament of the heaven above. And I proceeded and saw a place which burns day and night, where there are seven mountains of magnificent stones, <sup>7</sup> three towards the east, and three towards the south. And as for those towards the east, was of coloured stone, and one of pearl, and one of jacinth, and those towards the south of red stone. <sup>8</sup> But the middle one reached to heaven like the throne of God, of alabaster, and the summit of the <sup>9,10</sup> throne was of sapphire. And I saw a flaming fire. And beyond these mountains Is a region the end of the great earth: there the heavens were completed. And I saw a deep abyss, with columns of heavenly fire, and among them I saw columns of fire fall, which were beyond measure alike towards <sup>12</sup> the height and towards the depth. And beyond that abyss I saw a place which had no firmament of the heaven above, and no firmly founded earth beneath it: there was no water upon it, and no <sup>13</sup> birds, but it was a waste and horrible place. I saw there seven stars like great burning mountains, <sup>14</sup> and to me, when I inquired regarding them, The angel said: 'This place is the end of heaven and earth: this has become a prison for the stars and the host of heaven. And the stars which roll over the fire are they which have transgressed the commandment of the Lord in the beginning of <sup>16</sup> their rising, because they did not come forth at their appointed times. And He was wroth with them, and bound them till the time when their guilt should be consummated (even) for ten thousand years.'</p>",

And these places have been made to receive them till the day of their judgement and till their appointed period [till the period appointed], till the great judgement (comes) upon them.'
