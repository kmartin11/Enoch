			<p><sup>1</sup> The words of the blessing of Enoch, wherewith he blessed the elect and righteous, who will be <sup>2</sup> living in the day of tribulation, when all the wicked and godless are to be removed. And he took up his parable and said - Enoch, a righteous man, whose eyes were opened by God, saw the vision of the Holy One in the heavens, which the angels showed me, and from them I heard everything, and from them I understood as I saw, but not for this generation, but for a remote one which is <sup>3</sup> for to come. Concerning the elect I said, and took up my parable concerning them:</p>

<p>The Holy Great One will come forth from His dwelling,<br>
<sup>4</sup> And the eternal God will tread upon the earth, (even) on Mount Sinai,<br>
[And appear from His camp]<br>
And appear in the strength of His might from the heaven of heavens.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> And all shall be smitten with fear<br>
And the Watchers shall quake,<br>
And great fear and trembling shall seize them unto the ends of the earth.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> And the high mountains shall be shaken,<br>
And the high hills shall be made low,<br>
And shall melt like wax before the flame.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> And the earth shall be wholly rent in sunder,<br>
And all that is upon the earth shall perish,<br>
And there shall be a judgement upon all (men).</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> But with the righteous He will make peace.<br><br>
And will protect the elect,<br>
And mercy shall be upon them.<br><br>
And they shall all belong to God,<br>
And they shall be prospered,<br>
And they shall all be blessed.<br><br>
And He will help them all,<br>
And light shall appear unto them,<br>
And He will make peace with them.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> And behold! He cometh with ten thousands of His holy ones<br>
To execute judgement upon all,<br>
And to destroy all the ungodly:<br><br>
And to convict all flesh<br>
Of all the works of their ungodliness which they have ungodly committed,<br>
And of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 1 Summary</h3>
            <p>In a dramatic and apocalyptic vision, Enoch, a righteous figure with eyes opened by God, foresees a cataclysmic judgment that will engulf the world. As the Holy Great One descends from heaven to Mount Sinai, the wicked and godless will tremble in fear, while the righteous will be protected and blessed. The earth will be shaken to its foundations, and the mountains will melt like wax before the divine presence. Enoch's prophecy emphasizes the stark contrast between the fate of the elect, who will be prospered and at peace, and the ungodly, who will face destruction and judgment for their sins. As the Holy One arrives with ten thousands of holy ones, all flesh will be convicted of its ungodliness, and the ungodly will be destroyed. Through Enoch's vision, God reveals a message of salvation and judgment, emphasizing the importance of righteousness and obedience in the face of an impending cosmic upheaval.</p>
			<h3>Cross References (ESV)</h3>
			<p>Jude 1:14-15<br>
			It was also about these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, “Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones, to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</p>
			<p>Deuteronomy 33:2-3<br>
			The Lord came from Sinai and dawned from Seir upon us; he shone forth from Mount Paran; he came from the ten thousands of holy ones, with flaming fire at his right hand. Yes, he loved his people, all his holy ones were in his hand</p>
			<p>Psalm 37:28<br>
			For the Lord loves justice; he will not forsake his saints. They are preserved forever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
			<p>Isaiah 54:10<br>
			For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed,” says the Lord, who has compassion on you.</p>
			<p>Psalm 97:5<br>
			The mountains melt like wax before the Lord, before the Lord of all the earth.</p>

And the Great Glory sat thereon, and His raiment shone more brightly than the sun and <sup>21</sup> was whiter than any snow. None of the angels could enter and could behold His face by reason <sup>22</sup> of the magnificence and glory and no flesh could behold Him.

And the Head of Days sat on the throne of His glory, and the angels and the righteous stood around Him. <br> <sup>3</sup> And a great trembling seized me, <br> And fear took hold of me, <br> And my loins gave way, <br> And dissolved were my reins, <br> And I fell upon my face. <br> <sup>4</sup> And Michael sent another angel from among the holy ones and he raised me up, and when he had raised me up my spirit returned; for I had not been able to endure the look of this host, and the <br> <sup>5</sup> commotion and the quaking of the heaven. And Michael said unto me: 'Why art thou disquieted with such a vision? Until this day lasted the day of His mercy; and He hath been merciful and <br> <sup>6</sup> long-suffering towards those who dwell on the earth. And when the day, and the power, and the punishment, and the judgement come, which the Lord of Spirits hath prepared for those who worship not the righteous law, and for those who deny the righteous judgement, and for those who take His name in vain—that day is prepared, for the elect a covenant, but for sinners an inquisition. <br> <sup>7</sup> When the punishment of the Lord of Spirits shall rest upon them, it shall rest in order that the punishment of the Lord of Spirits may not come, in vain, and it shall slay the children with their mothers and the children with their fathers. Afterwards the judgement shall take place according to His mercy and His patience.' <br> <sup>8</sup> And on that day were two monsters parted, a female monster named Leviathan, to dwell in the <br> <sup>9</sup> abysses of the ocean over the fountains of the waters. But the male is named Behemoth, who occupied with his breast a waste wilderness named Duidain, on the east of the garden where the elect and righteous dwell, where my grandfather was taken up, the seventh from Adam, the first <br> <sup>10</sup> man whom the Lord of Spirits created. And I besought the other angel that he should show me the might of those monsters, how they were parted on one day and cast, the one into the abysses <br> <sup>11</sup> of the sea, and the other unto the dry land of the wilderness. And he said to me: 'Thou son of man, herein thou dost seek to know what is hidden.' <br> <sup>12</sup> And the other angel who went with me and showed me what was hidden told me what is first and last in the heaven in the height, and beneath the earth in the depth, and at the ends of the <br> <sup>13</sup> heaven, and on the foundation of the heaven. And the chambers of the winds, and how the winds are divided, and how they are weighed, and (how) the portals of the winds are reckoned, each according to the power of the wind, and the power of the lights of the moon, and according to the power that is fitting: and the divisions of the stars according to their names, and how all the divisions <br> <sup>14</sup> are divided. And the thunders according to the places where they fall, and all the divisions that are made among the lightnings that it may lighten, and their host that they may at once obey. <br> <sup>15</sup> For the thunder has places of rest (which) are assigned (to it) while it is waiting for its peal; and the thunder and lightning are inseparable, and although not one and undivided, they both go together <br> <sup>16</sup> through the spirit and separate not. For when the lightning lightens, the thunder utters its voice, and the spirit enforces a pause during the peal, and divides equally between them; for the treasury of their peals is like the sand, and each one of them as it peals is held in with a bridle, and turned back by the power of the spirit, and pushed forward according to the many quarters of the earth. <br> <sup>17</sup> And the spirit of the sea is masculine and strong, and according to the might of his strength he draws it back with a rein, and in like manner it is driven forward and disperses amid all the mountains <br> <sup>18</sup> of the earth. And the spirit of the hoar-frost is his own angel, and the spirit of the hail is a good <br> <sup>19</sup> angel. And the spirit of the snow has forsaken his chambers on account of his strength—There is a special spirit therein, and that which ascends from it is like smoke, and its name is frost. And the spirit of the mist is not united with them in their chambers, but it has a special chamber; for its course is glorious both in light and in darkness, and in winter and in summer, and in its chamber is an angel. <br> <sup>20</sup> And the spirit of the dew has its dwelling at the ends of the heaven, and is connected with the chambers of the rain, and its course is in winter and summer: and its clouds and the clouds of the <br> <sup>21</sup> mist are connected, and the one gives to the other. And when the spirit of the rain goes forth from its chamber, the angels come and open the chamber and lead it out, and when it is diffused over the whole earth it unites with the water on the earth. And whensoever it unites with the water on <br> <sup>22</sup> the earth . . . For the waters are for those who dwell on the earth; for they are nourishment for the earth from the Most High who is in heaven: therefore there is a measure for the rain, and the angels take it in charge. And these things I saw towards the Garden of the Righteous. <br> <sup>23</sup> And the angel of peace who was with me said to me: 'These two monsters, prepared conformably to the greatness of God, shall feed . . .' </p>",

And there are preserved the voices of the thunder and the light of the lightnings: and there are preserved the chambers of the hail and the chambers of the <br> <sup>24</sup> hoarfrost, and the chambers of the mist, and the chambers of the rain and the dew. And all these believe and give thanks before the Lord of Spirits, and glorify (Him) with all their power, and their food is in every act of thanksgiving: they thank and glorify and extol the name of the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever.] <br> <sup>25</sup> And this oath is mighty over them <br> And through it [they are preserved and] their paths are preserved, <br> And their course is not destroyed. <br> <sup>26</sup> And there was great joy amongst them, <br> And they blessed and glorified and extolled <br> Because the name of that Son of Man had been revealed unto them. <br> <sup>27</sup> And he sat on the throne of his glory, <br> And the sum of judgement was given unto the Son of Man, <br> And he caused the sinners to pass away and be destroyed from off the face of the earth, <br> And those who have led the world astray. <br> <sup>28</sup> With chains shall they be bound, <br> And in their assemblage-place of destruction shall they be imprisoned, <br> And all their works vanish from the face of the earth. <br> <sup>29</sup> And from henceforth there shall be nothing corruptible; <br> For that Son of Man has appeared, <br> And has seated himself on the throne of his glory, <br> And all evil shall pass away before his face, <br> And the word of that Son of Man shall go forth <br> And be strong before the Lord of Spirits. <br> </p>",

                text: "<p><sup>1</sup> The book of the courses of the luminaries of the heaven, the relations of each, according to their classes, their dominion and their seasons, according to their names and places of origin, and according to their months, which Uriel, the holy angel, who was with me, who is their guide, showed me; and he showed me all their laws exactly as they are, and how it is with regard to all the years of the world <sup>2</sup> and unto eternity, till the new creation is accomplished which dureth till eternity. And this is the first law of the luminaries: the luminary the Sun has its rising in the eastern portals of the heaven, <sup>3</sup> and its setting in the western portals of the heaven. And I saw six portals in which the sun rises, and six portals in which the sun sets and the moon rises and sets in these portals, and the leaders of the stars and those whom they lead: six in the east and six in the west, and all following each other <sup>4</sup> in accurately corresponding order: also many windows to the right and left of these portals. And first there goes forth the great luminary, named the Sun, and his circumference is like the <sup>5</sup> circumference of the heaven, and he is quite filled with illuminating and heating fire. The chariot on which he ascends, the wind drives, and the sun goes down from the heaven and returns through the north in order to reach the east, and is so guided that he comes to the appropriate (lit. ' that ') portal and <sup>6</sup> shines in the face of the heaven. In this way he rises in the first month in the great portal, which <sup>7</sup> is the fourth [those six portals in the cast]. And in that fourth portal from which the sun rises in the first month are twelve window-openings, from which proceed a flame when they are opened in <sup>8</sup> their season. When the sun rises in the heaven, he comes forth through that fourth portal thirty, <sup>9</sup> mornings in succession, and sets accurately in the fourth portal in the west of the heaven. And during this period the day becomes daily longer and the night nightly shorter to the thirtieth <sup>10</sup> morning. On that day the day is longer than the night by a ninth part, and the day amounts exactly to ten parts and the night to eight parts. And the sun rises from that fourth portal, and sets in the fourth and returns to the fifth portal of the east thirty mornings, and rises from it and sets in the fifth <sup>12</sup> portal. And then the day becomes longer by two parts and amounts to eleven parts, and the night <sup>13</sup> becomes shorter and amounts to seven parts. And it returns to the east and enters into the sixth <sup>14</sup> portal, and rises and sets in the sixth portal one-and-thirty mornings on account of its sign. On that day the day becomes longer than the night, and the day becomes double the night, and the day <sup>15</sup> becomes twelve parts, and the night is shortened and becomes six parts. And the sun mounts up to make the day shorter and the night longer, and the sun returns to the east and enters into the <sup>16</sup> sixth portal, and rises from it and sets thirty mornings. And when thirty mornings are accomplished, <sup>17</sup> the day decreases by exactly one part, and becomes eleven parts, and the night seven. And the sun goes forth from that sixth portal in the west, and goes to the east and rises in the fifth portal for <sup>18</sup> thirty mornings, and sets in the west again in the fifth western portal. On that day the day decreases by two parts, and amounts to ten parts and the night to eight parts. And the sun goes forth from that fifth portal and sets in the fifth portal of the west, and rises in the fourth portal for one-and-thirty <sup>20</sup> mornings on account of its sign, and sets in the west. On that day the day is equalized with the night, [and becomes of equal length], and the night amounts to nine parts and the day to <sup>21</sup> nine parts. And the sun rises from that portal and sets in the west, and returns to the east and rises <sup>22</sup> thirty mornings in the third portal and sets in the west in the third portal. And on that day the night becomes longer than the day, and night becomes longer than night, and day shorter than day till the thirtieth morning, and the night amounts exactly to ten parts and the day to eight <sup>23</sup> parts. And the sun rises from that third portal and sets in the third portal in the west and returns to the east, and for thirty mornings rises <sup>24</sup> in the second portal in the east, and in like manner sets in the second portal in the west of the heaven. And on that day the night amounts to eleven <sup>25</sup> parts and the day to seven parts. And the sun rises on that day from that second portal and sets in the west in the second portal, and returns to the east into the first portal for one-and-thirty <sup>26</sup> mornings, and sets in the first portal in the west of the heaven. And on that day the night becomes longer and amounts to the double of the day: and the night amounts exactly to twelve parts and <sup>27</sup> the day to six. And the sun has (therewith) traversed the divisions of his orbit and turns again on those divisions of his orbit, and enters that portal thirty mornings and sets also in the west <sup>28</sup> opposite to it. And on that night has the night decreased in length by a ninth part, and the night <sup>29</sup> has become eleven parts and the day seven parts. And the sun has returned and entered into the second portal in the east, and returns on those his divisions of his orbit for thirty mornings, rising <sup>30</sup> and setting. And on that day the night decreases in length, and the night amounts to ten parts <sup>31</sup> and the day to eight. And on that day the sun rises from that portal, and sets in the west, and returns to the east, and rises in the third portal for one-and-thirty mornings, and sets in the west of the heaven. <sup>32</sup> On that day the night decreases and amounts to nine parts, and the day to nine parts, and the night <sup>33</sup> is equal to the day and the year is exactly as to its days three hundred and sixty-four. And the length of the day and of the night, and the shortness of the day and of the night arise-through the course <sup>34</sup> of the sun these distinctions are made (lit. ' they are separated '). So it comes that its course becomes <sup>35</sup> daily longer, and its course nightly shorter. And this is the law and the course of the sun, and his return as often as he returns sixty times and rises, i.e. the great luminary which is named the sun, for ever and ever. And that which (thus) rises is the great luminary, and is so named according to <sup>37</sup> its appearance, according as the Lord commanded. As he rises, so he sets and decreases not, and rests not, but runs day and night, and his light is sevenfold brighter than that of the moon; but as regards size they are both equal.</p>",

But that white bull which had become a man came out of that vessel, and the three bulls with him, and one of those three was white like that bull, and one of them was red as blood, and one black: and that white bull departed from them. <sup>10</sup> And they began to bring forth beasts of the field and birds, so that there arose different genera: lions, tigers, wolves, dogs, hyenas, wild boars, foxes, squirrels, swine, falcons, vultures, kites, eagles, and ravens; and among them was born a white bull.

And the Lord brought the eleven sheep to live with it and to pasture with it among the wolves: and they multiplied and became many flocks of sheep. And the wolves began to fear them, and they oppressed them until they destroyed their little ones, and they cast their young into a river of much water: but those sheep began to <sup>16</sup> cry aloud on account of their little ones, and to complain unto their Lord. And a sheep which had been saved from the wolves fled and escaped to the wild asses; and I saw the sheep how they lamented and cried, and besought their Lord with all their might, till that Lord of the sheep descended at the voice of the sheep from a lofty abode, and came to them and pastured them. And He called that sheep which had escaped the wolves, and spake with it concerning the wolves that it should <sup>18</sup> admonish them not to touch the sheep. And the sheep went to the wolves according to the word of the Lord, and another sheep met it and went with it, and the two went and entered together into the assembly of those wolves, and spake with them and admonished them not to touch the <sup>19</sup> sheep from henceforth.

And I saw till they left off crying for that sheep and crossed that stream of water, and there arose the two sheep as leaders in the place of those which had led them and fallen asleep (lit. ' had fallen asleep and led <sup>40</sup> them '). And I saw till the sheep came to a goodly place, and a pleasant and glorious land, and I saw till those sheep were satisfied; and that house stood amongst them in the pleasant land. <sup>41</sup> And sometimes their eyes were opened, and sometimes blinded, till another sheep arose and led them and brought them all back, and their eyes were opened. <sup>42</sup> And the dogs and the foxes and the wild boars began to devour those sheep till the Lord of the sheep raised up [another sheep] a ram from their <sup>43</sup> midst, which led them. And that ram began to butt on either side those dogs, foxes, and wild <sup>44</sup> boars till he had destroyed them all. And that sheep whose eyes were opened saw that ram, which was amongst the sheep, till it forsook its glory and began to butt those sheep, and trampled upon them, and behaved itself <sup>45</sup> unseemly. And the Lord of the sheep sent the lamb to another lamb and raised it to being a ram and leader of the sheep instead of that <sup>46</sup> ram which had forsaken its glory. And it went to it and spake to it alone, and raised it to being a ram, and made it the prince and leader of the sheep; but during all these things those dogs <sup>47</sup> oppressed the sheep. And the first ram pursued that second ram, and that second ram arose and fled before it; and I saw till those dogs pulled <sup>48</sup> down the first ram. And that second ram arose <sup>49</sup> and led the [little] sheep. And those sheep grew and multiplied; but all the dogs, and foxes, and wild boars feared and fled before it, and that ram butted and killed the wild beasts, and those wild beasts had no longer any power among the <sup>48b</sup> sheep and robbed them no more of ought. And that ram begat many sheep and fell asleep; and a little sheep became ram in its stead, and became prince and leader of those sheep. <sup>50</sup> And that house became great and broad, and it was built for those sheep: (and) a tower lofty and great was built on the house for the Lord of the sheep, and that house was low, but the tower was elevated and lofty, and the Lord of the sheep stood on that tower and they offered a full table before Him. <sup>51</sup> And again I saw those sheep that they again erred and went many ways, and forsook that their house, and the Lord of the sheep called some from amongst the sheep and sent them to the sheep, <sup>52</sup> but the sheep began to slay them. And one of them was saved and was not slain, and it sped away and cried aloud over the sheep; and they sought to slay it, but the Lord of the sheep saved it from <sup>53</sup> the sheep, and brought it up to me, and caused it to dwell there. And many other sheep He sent to those sheep to testify unto them and lament over them. And after that I saw that when they forsook the house of the Lord and His tower they fell away entirely, and their eyes were blinded; and I saw the Lord of the sheep how He wrought much slaughter amongst them in their herds until <sup>55</sup> those sheep invited that slaughter and betrayed His place. And He gave them over into the hands of the lions and tigers, and wolves and hyenas, and into the hand of the foxes, and to all the wild <sup>56</sup> beasts, and those wild beasts began to tear in pieces those sheep. And I saw that He forsook that their house and their tower and gave them all into the hand of the lions, to tear and devour them, <sup>57</sup> into the hand of all the wild beasts. And I began to cry aloud with all my power, and to appeal to the Lord of the sheep, and to represent to Him in regard to the sheep that they were devoured <sup>58</sup> by all the wild beasts. But He remained unmoved, though He heard me, and He continued to watch over them. </p>",

                text: "<p><sup>1</sup> And I saw till that in this manner thirty-five shepherds undertook the pasturing (of the sheep), and they severally completed their periods as did the first; and others received them into their <sup>2</sup> hands, to pasture them for their period, each shepherd in his own period. And after that I saw in my vision all the birds of heaven coming, the eagles, the vultures, the kites, the ravens; but the eagles led all the birds; and they began to devour those sheep, and to pick out their eyes and to <sup>3</sup> devour their flesh. And the sheep cried out because their flesh was being devoured by the birds, <sup>4</sup> and as for me I looked and lamented in my sleep over that shepherd who pastured the sheep. And I saw until those sheep were devoured by the dogs and eagles and kites, and they left neither flesh nor skin nor sinew remaining on them till only their bones stood there: and their bones too fell <sup>5</sup> to the earth and the sheep became few. And I saw until that twenty-three had undertaken the pasturing and completed in their several periods fifty-eight times. <sup>6</sup> But behold lambs were borne by those white sheep, and they began to open their eyes and to see, <sup>7</sup> and to cry to the sheep. Yea, they cried to them, but they did not hearken to what they said to <sup>8</sup> them, but were exceedingly deaf, and their eyes were very exceedingly blinded. And I saw in the vision how the ravens flew upon those lambs and took one of those lambs, and dashed the sheep <sup>9</sup> in pieces and devoured them. And I saw till horns grew upon those lambs, and the ravens cast down their horns; and I saw till there sprouted a great horn of one of those sheep, and their eyes <sup>10</sup> were opened. And it looked at them [and their eyes opened], and it cried to the sheep, and the <sup>11</sup> rams saw it and all ran to it. And notwithstanding all this those eagles and vultures and ravens and kites still kept tearing the sheep and swooping down upon them and devouring them: still the sheep remained silent, but the rams lamented and cried out. And those ravens fought and battled with it and sought to lay low its horn, but they had no power over it. All the eagles and vultures and ravens and kites were gathered together, and there came with them all the sheep of the field, yea, they all came together, and helped each other to break that horn of the ram. <sup>19</sup> And I saw till a great sword was given to the sheep, and the sheep proceeded against all the beasts of the field to slay them, and all the beasts and the birds of the heaven fled before their face. And I saw that man, who wrote the book according to the command of the Lord, till he opened that book concerning the destruction which those twelve last shepherds had wrought, and showed that they had destroyed much more than their predecessors, before the Lord of the sheep. And I saw till the Lord of the sheep came unto them and took in His hand the staff of His wrath, and smote the earth, and the earth clave asunder, and all the beasts and all the birds of the heaven fell from among those sheep, and were swallowed up in the earth and it covered them. <sup>20</sup> And I saw till a throne was erected in the pleasant land, and the Lord of the sheep sat Himself thereon, and the other took the sealed books and opened those books before the Lord of the sheep. <sup>21</sup> And the Lord called those men the seven first white ones, and commanded that they should bring before Him, beginning with the first star which led the way, all the stars whose privy members <sup>22</sup> were like those of horses, and they brought them all before Him. And He said to that man who wrote before Him, being one of those seven white ones, and said unto him: ' Take those seventy shepherds to whom I delivered the sheep, and who taking them on their own authority slew more <sup>23</sup> than I commanded them.' And behold they were all bound, I saw, and they all stood before Him. <sup>24</sup> And the judgement was held first over the stars, and they were judged and found guilty, and went to the place of condemnation, and they were cast into an abyss, full of fire and flaming, and full <sup>25</sup> of pillars of fire. And those seventy shepherds were judged and found guilty, and they were cast <sup>26</sup> into that fiery abyss. And I saw at that time how a like abyss was opened in the midst of the earth, full of fire, and they brought those blinded sheep, and they were all judged and found guilty and <sup>27</sup> cast into this fiery abyss, and they burned; now this abyss was to the right of that house. And I saw those sheep burning and their bones burning. <sup>28</sup> And I stood up to see till they folded up that old house; and carried off all the pillars, and all the beams and ornaments of the house were at the same time folded up with it, and they carried <sup>29</sup> it off and laid it in a place in the south of the land. And I saw till the Lord of the sheep brought a new house greater and loftier than that first, and set it up in the place of the first which had beer folded up: all its pillars were new, and its ornaments were new and larger than those of the first, the old one which He had taken away, and all the sheep were within it. <sup>30</sup> And I saw all the sheep which had been left, and all the beasts on the earth, and all the birds of the heaven, falling down and doing homage to those sheep and making petition to and obeying <sup>31</sup> them in every thing. And thereafter those three who were clothed in white and had seized me by my hand [who had taken me up before], and the hand of that ram also seizing hold of me, they <sup>32</sup> took me up and set me down in the midst of those sheep before the judgement took place. And those <sup>33</sup> sheep were all white, and their wool was abundant and clean. And all that had been destroyed and dispersed, and all the beasts of the field, and all the birds of the heaven, assembled in that house, and the Lord of the sheep rejoiced with great joy because they were all good and had returned to <sup>34</sup> His house. And I saw till they laid down that sword, which had been given to the sheep, and they brought it back into the house, and it was sealed before the presence of the Lord, and all the sheep <sup>35</sup> were invited into that house, but it held them not. And the eyes of them all were opened, and they <sup>36</sup> saw the good, and there was not one among them that did not see. And I saw that that house was large and broad and very full. <sup>37</sup> And I saw that a white bull was born, with large horns and all the beasts of the field and all the <sup>38</sup> birds of the air feared him and made petition to him all the time. And I saw till all their generations were transformed, and they all became white bulls; and the first among them became a lamb, and that lamb became a great animal and had great black horns on its head; and the Lord of the sheep <sup>39</sup> rejoiced over it and over all the oxen. And I slept in their midst: and I awoke and saw everything. <sup>40</sup> This is the vision which I saw while I slept, and I awoke and blessed the Lord of righteousness and <sup>41</sup> gave Him glory. Then I wept with a great weeping and my tears stayed not till I could no longer endure it: when I saw, they flowed on account of what I had seen; for everything shall come and <sup>42</sup> be fulfilled, and all the deeds of men in their order were shown to me. On that night I remembered the first dream, and because of it I wept and was troubled-because I had seen that vision.</p>",

And he hath assigned them their recompense, because they have been found to be such as loved heaven more than their life in the world, and though they were trodden under foot of wicked men, and experienced abuse and reviling from them and were put to shame, <sup>11</sup> yet they blessed Me. And now I will summon the spirits of the good who belong to the generation of light, and I will transform those who were born in darkness, who in the flesh were not recompensed <sup>12</sup> with such honour as their faithfulness deserved. And I will bring forth in shining light those who <sup>13</sup> have loved My holy name, and I will seat each on the throne of his honour. And they shall be resplendent for times without number; for righteousness is the judgement of God; for to the faithful <sup>14</sup> He will give faithfulness in the habitation of upright paths. And they shall see those who were , <sup>15</sup> born in darkness led into darkness, while the righteous shall be resplendent. And the sinners shall cry aloud and see them resplendent, and they indeed will go where days and seasons are prescribed for them.'</p>",
